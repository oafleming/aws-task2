# AWS EKS Skeleton Project

This project uses Terraform to provision an AWS EKS cluster. The initial setup is a skeleton for learning and version control. Future steps will add networking, node groups, IAM roles, and three highly available web apps deployed in self-healing pods.

## Getting Started
1. Edit `main.tf` to add your subnet IDs and IAM role ARN.
2. Run `terraform init` and `terraform plan` in the `terraform` directory.
3. Follow step-by-step commits to build out the full solution.
